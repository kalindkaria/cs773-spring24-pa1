1. Have you strictly adhered to the submission guidelines?

2. Have you received or provided any assistance for this assignment beyond public discussions with peers/TAs?

3. If you answered "yes" to the previous question, please specify what part of code you've taken and from whom you've taken it.


## Directory Structure
Folders - `task2a`, `task2b`, `task3a` and optionally `task3b`. Each of these directories should contain:

1. `sender.c`
2. `receiver.c`
3. `utils.c`
4. `utils.h`
5. `MakeFile`
6. Additional relevant files

If the implementation for `task3a` and `task3b` is the same, put the code in the folder `task3a`. Apart from the above folders, there should be a completely filled README file.


Your submission should be `zip` file with \<roll-number\>.zip. Only one team member should submit, else there will be penalties.
